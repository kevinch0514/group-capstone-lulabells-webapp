      Lula Bell's is made possible through the generosity of Decker Anstrom and Sherry Hiemstra in memory of their
      son Tom Anstrom, a member of the Class of 2004, who loved Davidson and who believed that every student should
      have the opportunity to take full advantage of all Davidson offers.
